    A solver class for finding optimal pairs in a grid.

    Attributes
    ----------
    grid : Grid
        The grid to be solved.
    pairs : list[tuple[tuple[int, int], tuple[int, int]]]
        A list of pairs, each being a tuple ((i1, j1), (i2, j2)) representing paired cells.
    rules : str
